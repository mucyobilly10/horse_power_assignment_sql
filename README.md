# Title: horse_power_assignment_sql

A PL/SQL-based project that showcases the power and flexibility of **window functions** in managing and analyzing database records. This project explores real-world scenarios where window functions such as `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, and others are used to provide advanced query solutions.

# üß† QUERIES, RESULTS, EXPLANATION & SCREENSHOTS.
 <BR>

## 1.üìå _Dataset Selection_
For this assignment, We have chosen to work with one dataset only ‚Äî the employees dataset. 
All required SQL window function tasks (comparisons, ranking, top records, earliest records, and aggregations) 
have been applied to this single dataset as allowed by the assignment instructions.
 <BR>
  <br>
  <br>

## 2. üì° _CREATING TABLE AND PERFORMING QUERY OPERATIONS_

 <BR>
 


### üìä Table Structure:

 We have to create a table for our project and we name it " _**employees**_ ". We created it using the following codes
 <BR>
 
 ```sql

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id        NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name      VARCHAR2(50),
    department    VARCHAR2(30),
    salary        NUMBER(10,2),
    hire_date     DATE
);

```

<br>

## 3. üìù _DATA INSERTION._

 <BR>

For the purpose of keeping the readme short, I chose to use few example to demostrate the insertion of data in our Tables. 

###  Insertion for employees Table
 <BR>


```sql
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Alice',   'HR',       4000, TO_DATE('2021-01-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (2, 'Bob',     'IT',       6000, TO_DATE('2020-03-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 'IT',       5500, TO_DATE('2022-06-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (4, 'David',   'Finance',  4800, TO_DATE('2019-11-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (5, 'Eva',     'HR',       4200, TO_DATE('2021-07-23', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (6, 'Frank',   'Finance',  4800, TO_DATE('2023-01-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (7, 'Grace',   'IT',       6000, TO_DATE('2022-02-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (8, 'Helen',   'HR',       4000, TO_DATE('2020-10-30', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (9, 'Ian',     'Finance',  5100, TO_DATE('2021-03-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (10, 'Jake',   'IT',       5500, TO_DATE('2023-04-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

<br>
 <BR>
 ###### _Explanation:_
 10 records were inserted to allow analysis using `LAG`, `LEAD`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, and aggregate functions.
<br>
<br>
<br>
## 4. ‚úÖ _Compare Values with Previous or Next Records_
 <BR>
 
### üìå Use `LAG()` and `LEAD()` to compare salaries
 <BR>
 
```sql
SELECT 
    emp_id,
    emp_name,
    department,
    salary,
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS prev_salary,
    LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS next_salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary > LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) THEN 'HIGHER'
        WHEN salary < LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) THEN 'LOWER'
        ELSE 'EQUAL'
    END AS salary_vs_previous
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date;

```
 <BR>

 <BR>
  <br>
  ###### _Explanation:_
 Compares each employee‚Äôs salary with the previous employee by hire date.
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 5. ‚úÖ _Ranking Data within a Category_
 <BR>

### üìå Use `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` by department (based on salary)
 <BR>
  
```sql
SELECT 
    emp_id,
    emp_name,
    department,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_salary,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank_salary
FROM employees;

```

  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
 #### _Explanation:_
 ###### _Difference between `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`_
 
- `RANK()` skips ranks if there are ties.

- `DENSE_RANK()` does not skip; ties get the same rank, and next rank continues.

<br>

 So, the screenshot above shows the difference between `RANK()`(may skip numbers) and `DENSE_RANK()`(does not skip).
 
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 6. ‚úÖ _Identifying Top 3 Records per Department_

  <br>
  
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        emp_id,
        emp_name,
        department,
        salary,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM employees
) 
WHERE rnk <= 3;

```

 <br>
  <br>
 ###### _Explanation:_
Retrieves the top 3 earners from each department.
<br>
<br>
<br>
## 7 .‚úÖ _Finding the Earliest 2 Employees per Department_

  <br>
  
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        emp_id,
        emp_name,
        department,
        hire_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date ASC) AS row_num
    FROM employees
)
WHERE row_num <= 2;

```

  <br>
  <br>
 ###### _Explanation:_
Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to get the two earliest hires per department.
<br>
<br>
<br>
## 8. ‚úÖ _Aggregation with Window Functions_

  <br>
  
```sql
SELECT 
    emp_id,
    emp_name,
    department,
    salary,
    MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS max_salary_in_dept,
    MAX(salary) OVER () AS overall_max_salary
FROM employees;

```
